# React Native Weather Application

A simple and quick Weather Application created with React Native.

## Project Goals

The goal is to create a quick, easy to use React Native Android Application.

- [x] Setup React, Node.js, & JDK.
- [x] Setup Android Studio for Emulator & external device testing.
- [ ] Setup a simple home page layout for displaying current and forecasted weather information.
- [ ] Separate code files and document extensively as if other developers were working on this project.
- [ ] Obtain a devices current location (longitude & latitude), for fetching from weather API.
- [ ] Fetch weather data from the NOAA API and display it to the user.
- [ ] Allow the user to save multiple locations to check weather in more than just the current location.
- [ ] Give the user a few settings to customize their application experience (refresh period, etc).
- [ ] Make the application look nice, utilize photos, backdrops, and light/dark themes.
- [ ] Create a simple home screen widget that will update once every hour.

# How To Run

It is recommended to follow [this](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native)
tutorial. The tutorial listed walks through installing all dependencies and Android studio setup for
device emulation too.

## Project Dependencies

Here is a list of packages and resources that are needed for the codebase to function. If following the above guide, the process is relatively straight forward. 

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) ([Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started))
- Node.js ([Docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs) | [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
- Java Development
  Kit ([JDK11 Download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html))
- Android Studio ([Download](https://developer.android.com/studio))
